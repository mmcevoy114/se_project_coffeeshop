# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I feel that additional content can be added to some of the sections such as
a news feed or a blog that would make the page more appealing and informative.
I will try to implement some of these ideas and update the code.
